# ONLSTM

This repository contains the ONLSTM checkpoints and their parses analyzed in the paper Latent Tree Learning with Ordered Neurons: What Parses Does It Produce?

The repo is originally forked from [Ordered-Neurons](https://github.com/yikangshen/Ordered-Neurons) by Yikang Shen et al.

## ONLSTM Checkpoints and Parses

The 5 ONLSTM checkpoints can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YfgVFxZ7lYWqOneEYKL3WdQxzY6745cR?usp=sharing).

The parses generated by these checkpoints can be found in [parse_results](parse_results).

To reproduce these checkpoints yourself, you need to:

1. Install PyTorch 0.4 and NLTK

2. Download PTB raw text data from [Penn Treebank corpus](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/75e435f98ab7aaa7f82632d4e633e8e03070e8ac/word_language_model/data/penn).

3. Use the command: 
```python main.py --batch_size 20 --dropout 0.45 --dropouth 0.3 --dropouti 0.5 --wdrop 0.45 --chunk_size 10 --seed 141 --epochs 1000 --save ONLSTM-1.pt```

* If you want to generate a parse using your checkpoint, you will need to request [Penn Treebank Parsed](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T42) data, and use the command:
```python test_phrase_grammar.py --cuda```

The random seeds we use are: 141, 494, 1998, 982, and 192.

## Random Baselines

The random baseline parses we use in the study can be found [here](random_parses).

To generate the random parses yourself, you need to:

1. request [Penn Treebank Parsed](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T42) data.

2. Extract the raw texts and arrange them in the format of [wsj10_sample.txt](wsj10_sample.txt) and [wsjtest_sample.txt](wsjtest_sample.txt). We are only providing samples instead of releasing the complete version of the formatted data because the source data are not publicly available without requesting.

3. Run the following command:
```parse_by_baseline.py```
